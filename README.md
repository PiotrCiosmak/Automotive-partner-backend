## General Information

The website for this taxi corporation provides a comprehensive platform for both drivers and management to efficiently manage their operations. Drivers can easily start and end their shifts, report accidents, submit availability, view their calendar, check billing and statistics, and report any billing errors. Management has the ability to manage drivers and cars, including adding/removing them, blocking/unlocking, granting/revoking permissions, and updating mileage. They can also access important information such as schedules, damages, availability, calendar, bills, and reported bugs, and make modifications to shift parameters as needed. Overall, this website serves as a central hub for all the necessary tools and functionalities to streamline the operations of the taxi corporation.
